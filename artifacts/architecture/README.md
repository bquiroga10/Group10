**Code Design**
-------------------------

![Class diagram](https://github.com/bquiroga10/Group10/blob/master/artifacts/architecture/ClassDiagram.PNG)

**Data Design**
-------------------------

We are using Open Trivia Database as a pool for our questions, so there is not a need for 

**Buisness Rules**
------------------------

As we are using the free version of Unity, we cannot exceed $100,000 of funding in a 12 month period

**Resource Management**
------------------------

Since we are using Open Trivia DB, resource management is not a factor in our build

**Security**
-------------------------

TBD

**Performance**
------------------------

TBD

**Scalability**
------------------------

Only one user will ever be playing, so Scalability is not an issue.

**Interoperability**
------------------------

This is a single player game, so there

**Internationalization/Localization**
------------------------

As this game is very text heavy, we have no plans to localize this game into other languages

**Input/Output**
------------------------

Despite being a video game, the is an input/output field with regards to reading and printing out the questiongs, how this works is TBD

**Error Processing**
------------------------

Most of the errors within the video game will be handeled within unity. The errors in regards to pulling from Open Trivia DB will have to be done manualy.

**Fault Tolerence**
------------------------

TBD

**Architectural Feasibility**
------------------------------

TBD

**Overengineering**
------------------------------

TBD

**Build-vs-Buy Decisions**
------------------------------

Unity has quite a bit of free assets in the unity store, as well as using Open Trivia DB

**Reuse**
-----------------------------

TBD

**Change Strategy**
-----------------------------
