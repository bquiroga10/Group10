# POOSD Product Vision
**Group 10: Jacob Magnuson, Jacob Pfaffenbichler, William Quiroga, and Amro Zidan**

We are developing a strategic desktop game centered around trivia and general knowledge questions. The game is designed to appeal to a broad demographic; made to entertain in a short time window. The bite-size nature of the game makes it appealing to anybody wanting a quick distraction from another pending task, or a mental refresh.

We will combine the mental challenge of decision-based strategy games with the novelty of assorted trivia questions from a variety of categories, giving a new spin to both styles of gameplay. Some questions will be time-based, while others may require some deep thought to get right. Correct responses will be rewarded with progression in the game, or power-ups to enhance the players' experience.

Unlike normal online quizzes, our game will allow the player the free will to choose their path through a room full of questions. They will be able to decide how and when to use the power-ups they earn, potentially giving them a leg up in getting through the game. By playing through multiple rounds of the game, a thoughtful player may grow in their navigation of the board and tactical use of power-ups, giving them more satisfaction in finishing the game quickly and accurately.
